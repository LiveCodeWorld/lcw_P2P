The `<$hello>` test-action widget is registered:\n\n<$hello/>\n\nTiddlyWiki does not directly support inline JavaScript execution via widgets. Instead, JavaScript must either be embedded in a custom plugin (or maybe executed via an appropriate API like tm-sendmessage???).\n\n! Best Practice\nThe [[$:/plugins/custom/ExecuteJavaScript]] macro exports `exports.callLivecode = CallLivecodeWidget;`, which can be called in a button with `<$callLivecode>`. As you can see by the javascript this (currntly) simply calls the [[tiddlyButton_Call]] function in LiveCode. The idea I believe was to obtain a result in javascript - which as i remember is not going to work (yet). Here are some `callLivecode` button examples:\n\n```\n<$button>\n  $callLivecode\n  <$callLivecode/>\n</$button>\n```\n\n<$button>\n  $callLivecode\n  <$callLivecode/>\n</$button>\n\n<$button>\n  Send \"Hello\" with $callLivecode\n  <$callLivecode message=\"Hello\"/>\n</$button>\n\n<$vars dynamicMessage=\"This is a Dynamic Message from TW\">\n  <$button>\n    Send Dynamic Message with $callLivecode\n    <$callLivecode message=<<dynamicMessage>>/>\n  </$button>\n</$vars>\n\n! Live Actions\nHere are some examples of LiveButtons that interact with Livecode. These ones have been styled using the ShirazPlugin.\n\n<$button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-info btn-sm\">\n  EditScript of stack 'lib_TiddlyMessage'\n  <$callLivecode message=\"EditScript stack 'lib_TiddlyMessage'\"/>\n</$button>\n\n<$link overrideClass=\"btn btn-warning\" to=\"Warning\">Link to Warning</$link>\n\n<$button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-danger btn-sm\">\n  HkeyEdit 'C tiddlyButton_Call'\n  <$callLivecode message=\"HkeyEdit 'C tiddlyButton_Call'\"/>\n</$button>\n\n! See also\nSome experiments regarding asynchrounous interacctions between LiveCode and TiddlyWiki:\n\n* [[Experimental Messaging]]\n\nThe result of these tests are displayed in the [[Test]] tiddler, and sometimes logged in the [[test-log]] tiddler.\n\n```\n<$button>\n  $wikiscript with Hello\n  <$wikiscript message=\"Hello\"/>\n</$button>\n```\n\nSee also work in progress using transclusion for multiline text only messages:\n\n* [[Multiline LiveButton Messages]]","title":"LiveButton","modified":"2025-03-11T15:42:00.383Z"},{"created":"2025-01-27T21:27:39.027Z","text":"","tags":["Inbox","todo","Milestone"],"modified":"2025-01-27T21:28:44.950Z","title":"Project Release","due":"20250203235959999"},{"created":"2025-01-27T21:25:06.229Z","text":"","tags":["Inbox","todo","Milestone"],"modified":"2025-01-27T21:29:02.052Z","title":"Project Specification","due":"20250127235959999"},{"created":"2025-01-27T21:24:24.684Z","text":"<<timeline-vertical filter:\"[tag[Milestone]]\" date:\"due\" dateformat:\"mmm DDth\">>","title":"Roadmap","modified":"2025-01-27T21:24:27.545Z"},{"created":"2025-01-25T20:54:54.134Z","text":"<<interstitial>>","title":"Working on","modified":"2025-01-27T21:27:23.766Z"}]
